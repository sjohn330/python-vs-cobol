# ~~~README~~~
* This is a bubble sort program written in COBOL and compiled with GNUCobol.
* I have compiled it twice in two different enviroments, once inside Windows Subsystem for Linux (Ubuntu) and again in MacOS 11 Big Sur. (Note the file size difference)
* There are two nearly identical scripts included in each folder, runCobolProgram and runPythonProgram.
* Executing those scripts from the terminal will run the Cobol and Python bubble sort programs respectively.
### WARNING : These programs took me hours to run with the specified files. They both work but I recommend no more than 50,000 items.
